Exercises: Develop and Deploy Smart Contracts with Truffle The goal of this exercise is to create smart contract, compile and deploy it using the Truffle Framework and add unit tests for the contract logic using Truffle. We will deploy the smart contract in Ganache-CLI with Truffle. Then write unit tests for the smart contract and test it with Truffle. The contract will be written in Solidity. Before we get started, you must have Truffle and Ganache-cli installed. Ganache-cli will be the tool we will use to create a private blockchain that runs on our machine only.
